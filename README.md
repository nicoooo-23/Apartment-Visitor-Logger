## Project Structure Overview

The project is organized into iterative drafts to track development progress:

* **AVL:** The current working directory containing the finalized logic and assets.
* **FullStackDraftV1 & V2:** Evolutionary steps where backend logic and frontend processing were developed and refined.
* **assets:** Stores CSS and media files, including the AVL logo and key icon.
* **includes:** Contains reusable PHP components like headers and navigation bars to maintain a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) codebase.
